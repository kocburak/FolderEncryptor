# Usage

Simplest way to encrypt your folder is:
```
FolderEncryptor.exe enc --dir C:\input-folder --desDir C:\encrypted-folder 
```

And to decrypt your folder:
```
FolderEncryptor.exe dec --dir C:\encrypted-folder --desDir C:\decrypted-folder 
```

For additional security we highly recomend the usage of `--enc-filenames` flag

# Commands

**The command `FolderEncryptor.exe --help` lists the available commands and `FolderEncryptor.exe <command> --help` shows more details for an individual command.**

| Command        | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **enc**        | Encrypt the spesified target.  |
| **dec**        | Decrypt the spesified target.  |
| **analyze**    | Analyze the spesified target.  |

# Building

### Prerequisite

* Visual Studio Version 17
* .NET 6 SDK

# Road Map

- Option to securely erase unencrypted files. (looking at you Gutmann Algorithm ðŸ‘€).
- Option to overwrite the original file to erase unencrypted data. (This may be not possible if `--enc-filenames` flag is set)
- A way to use the file without decrypting to file system first.

# IMPORTANT NOTE!

When you encrypt your folder and than delete the old folder. Keep in mind that it can still be **recovered**! We are planning to include secure delete of the folder bu meanwhile you must use a 3rd Party tool for that such as Microsoft's [Sysinternals SDelete](https://learn.microsoft.com/tr-tr/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete) for Windows 10 and up.
