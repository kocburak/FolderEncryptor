# FolderEncryptor
FolderEncryptor is a tool to enable you to encyrpt a whole folder, hence the name.

# Usage

Simplest way to encrypt your folder is:
```
FolderEncryptor.exe enc --dir C:\input-folder --desDir C:\encrypted-folder 
```

And to dencrypt your folder:
```
FolderEncryptor.exe dec --dir C:\encrypted-folder --desDir C:\decrypted-folder 
```

For additional security we highly recomend the usage of `--enc-filenames` flag
